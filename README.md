# Code Climate Dart-Engine

`codeclimate-dart` is a Code Climate engine that wraps [dart metrics](https://github.com/wrike/metrics/). You can run it on your command line using the Code Climate CLI, or on Code Climate's hosted analysis platform.

### Installation

1. If you haven't already, [install the Code Climate CLI](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate).
2. Run `codeclimate engines:enable dart`. This command both installs the engine and enables it in your `.codeclimate.yml` file.
3. You're ready to analyze! Browse into your project's folder and run `codeclimate analyze`.
